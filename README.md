Gito: Git Helper....

I created this script to ease commit and push transactions to the github.... As, I'm very much lazy that, I hate typing same commands everytime....

Options this script contains:-
-h    for this help page
-a    to choose/add single/multiple files
-A    to add all files
-c    for commiting files
-o    to add or change origin
-p    for pushing files to origin\n


Currently, I'm working on this script to make it do other thing like revert commit, creating new branch etc.,
